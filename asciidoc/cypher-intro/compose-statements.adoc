= Composing large statements

[abstract]

This section describes how to compose large statements using the `UNION` and `WITH` keywords.

[[cypher-intro-large-statements-example-graph]]
== Example graph

We continue using the same example data as before:

[source,cypher]
----
CREATE (matrix:Movie { title:"The Matrix",released:1997 })
CREATE (cloudAtlas:Movie { title:"Cloud Atlas",released:2012 })
CREATE (forrestGump:Movie { title:"Forrest Gump",released:1994 })
CREATE (keanu:Person { name:"Keanu Reeves", born:1964 })
CREATE (robert:Person { name:"Robert Zemeckis", born:1951 })
CREATE (tom:Person { name:"Tom Hanks", born:1956 })
CREATE (tom)-[:ACTED_IN { roles: ["Forrest"]}]->(forrestGump)
CREATE (tom)-[:ACTED_IN { roles: ['Zachry']}]->(cloudAtlas)
CREATE (robert)-[:DIRECTED]->(forrestGump)
----

This is the resulting graph:

[[cypher-intro-large-statements-union]]
== UNION

If you want to combine the results of two statements that have the same result structure, you can use `UNION [ALL]`.

For example, the following statement lists both actors and directors:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN]->(movie:Movie)
RETURN actor.name AS name, type(r) AS type, movie.title AS title
UNION
MATCH (director:Person)-[r:DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie)
RETURN director.name AS name, type(r) AS type, movie.title AS title
----

[queryresult]
----
+-------------------------------------------------+
| name              | type       | title          |
+-------------------------------------------------+
| "Tom Hanks"       | "ACTED_IN" | "Cloud Atlas"  |
| "Tom Hanks"       | "ACTED_IN" | "Forrest Gump" |
| "Robert Zemeckis" | "DIRECTED" | "Forrest Gump" |
+-------------------------------------------------+

3 rows
----

Note that the returned columns must be aliased in the same way in all the sub-clauses.

[TIP]
====
The query above is equivalent to this more compact query:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (actor:Person)-[r:ACTED_IN|DIRECTED]->(movie:Movie)
RETURN actor.name AS name, type(r) AS type, movie.title AS title
----

[[cypher-intro-large-statements-with]]
== WITH

In Cypher it is possible to chain fragments of statements together, similar to how it is done within a data-flow pipeline.
Each fragment works on the output from the previous one, and its results can feed into the next one.
_Only_ columns declared in the `WITH` clause are available in subsequent query parts.

The `WITH` clause is used to combine the individual parts and declare which data flows from one to the other.
`WITH` is similar to the `RETURN` clause.
The difference is that the `WITH` clause does not finish the query, but prepares the input for the next part.
Expressions, aggregations, ordering and pagination can be used in the same way as in the `RETURN` clause.
The only difference is all columns must be aliased.

In the example below, we collect the movies someone appeared in, and then filter out those which appear in only one movie:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (person:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WITH person, count(*) AS appearances, collect(m.title) AS movies
WHERE appearances > 1
RETURN person.name, appearances, movies
----

[queryresult]
----
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| person.name | appearances | movies                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| "Tom Hanks" | 2           | ["Cloud Atlas", "Forrest Gump"] |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+

1 row
